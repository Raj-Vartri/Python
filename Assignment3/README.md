# Task1 --> Factorial Calculator in Python

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number. It defines a reusable function using either an iterative or recursive approach, making it a solid exercise in function definition and mathematical logic.

## Features
- User-defined function for factorial calculation  
- Supports both iterative and recursive logic  
- Sample function call with output display  
- Beginner-friendly, readable code structure
