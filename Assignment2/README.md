# Task 1 ---> Check if a Number is Even or Odd

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

## Overview
This program determines the parity (even or odd) of a given integer. It prompts the user for input, evaluates the number using the modulo operator `%`, and prints the appropriate result.

## Features
- Accepts user input dynamically.
- Simple and efficient logic using an `if-else` statement.
- Provides clear output indicating whether the number is even or odd.

# Task 2 ---> Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

## Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

## Overview
This program efficiently computes the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop. It initializes a sum variable, iterates through the range, adds each number to the total, and prints the final result.

## Features
- Utilizes a `for` loop for iteration.
- Implements a simple and effective summation logic.
- Displays the computed sum in a clear format.
