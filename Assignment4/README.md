## ---> Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Overview

This task teaches you how to *safely read the contents of a file*. The script attempts to open `sample.txt`, read its contents line by line, and display them. It also demonstrates the use of exception handling to ensure your program doesn't crash when the file is missing.

### Goals

- Open and read a text file using Python
- Output each line to the console
- Catch and handle `FileNotFoundError` using a `try-except` block

### Features

- Graceful error handling when the file is absent
- Clean console output for better readability
- Beginner-friendly structure and logic

## ---> Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Overview

This task introduces user interaction with files. The script collects text input from the user, writes it to `output.txt`, then allows appending more data. Finally, it displays the complete contents of the file. It's a hands-on way to learn how writing, appending, and reading work together in Python.

### Goals

- Accept input from the user and write to a file
- Allow additional input to be appended
- Read and display the final contents of the file

### Features

- Real-time user input handling
- Demonstrates both write (`'w'`) and append (`'a'`) file modes
- Final read operation to verify written content
